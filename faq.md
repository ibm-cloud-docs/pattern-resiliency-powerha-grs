## How should I set up my page?
{: #faq-page-setup}
{: faq}

* Use "FAQ for xxx" as your title, where xxx is the short name with no trademarks.
* Name the file `faq.md` for URL readability.
* If you require multiple FAQ files, group under a "FAQs" topicgroup and use a unique name for each file.
* Add each question as an H2.
* Use paragraph text following the associated H2 question for each answer.
* Set the `faq` content type attribute definition at the top of your file.
* Set the `faq` content type attribute on a new line following each H2 question.
* Do not repeat task steps. Summarize and link off to task topic.

## What should I include in my FAQ?
{: #faq-content-include}
{: faq}

Each answer should be approximately one to five sentences. You want to make sure you are not re-documenting information that is already available in documentation because then you'd have to maintain it in two places. If a more detailed explanation for the question exists out in a documentation page, give a concise answer here, and then link out to the doc.
